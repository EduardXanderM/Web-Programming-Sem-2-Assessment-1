			<h2>Method</h2>
			<ol> <!--OL tag stands for ordered list-->
				<li>Finely dice the onion and heat a tbsp of vegetable oil in a pan. Cook the onions on a low heat until softened (approx 10 mins), and then increase to a medium heat until golden
					 - stirring occasionally to stop them from catching. Add the minced garlic, grated carrot, ginger and apple and cook for a further 2 minutes. Set aside.</li>
				<li>In a clean pan, fry the beef ove a medium heat until browned on all sides. Set aside.</li>
				<li>Now, dry-fry the flour until golden and add the other spices and fry for 1-2 minutes on a medium heat until fragrant.</li>
				<li>In a heavy based pan with a lid, over a medium heat add the spice mix, onion mix and beef and combine. Add the red wine, stock and bay leaf and bring to a boil. Turn the heat
					 down and leave on a gentle simmer with the lid on for 90 mins - 2 hours, until the beef is tender and falling apart.</li>
				<li>Once ready, add the coffee, chocolate, yoghurt, honey and worchestershire sauce and simmer with the lid off for 15 minutes.</li>
				<li>Take off the heat and remove the bay leaf, now stir in the butter and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with rice.</li>

			<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Make it your own! Adjust the spices to your personal taste. For example, reducing or omitting the chilli powder and black pepper will make the curry milder.</li>
				<li>Have patience when you cook the onions - the longer you let them fry (golden brown is best, not fully caramelised), the tastier they will be in the end.</li>
				<li>The longer you simmer the beef, the more tender it will become, but don't forget to add a little more water to the pot if it cooks down too far, or you'll burn thge meath!</li>
				<li>Curry gets even better when it's had a chance to rest and the ingredients have fully cross-infused their flavours. That means your leftovers will be even more delicious!
					 Let your curry room to cool to room temperature first, then store in an airtight container in the fridge.</li>
				<li>Your curry will be good for up to three days in the fridge, or one month in the freezer (keep in mind, freezing can change the texture of the meat/veggies).</li>
