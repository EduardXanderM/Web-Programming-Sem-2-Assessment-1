		<hr>
		<span style="text-align: left;">
			<p>The protagonist, a high school student, is falsely accused of assault while trying to help a woman and is sentenced to probation. Sent to Tokyo, he moves in with Sojiro Sakura, a coffee shop owner, and enrolls at Shujin Academy. While trying to adjust to his new life, he befriends Ryuji Sakamoto, an outcast with a grudge against their abusive gym teacher, Suguru Kamoshida.</p>
			<p>One day, they accidentally stumble into a mysterious alternate dimension known as the Metaverse, where people’s distorted desires take the form of Palaces—manifestations of their corrupt minds. In Kamoshida’s Palace, they meet Morgana, a talking cat-like creature who teaches them about Persona powers. The protagonist unlocks his Persona, Arsène, becoming the leader of a group that would later be known as the Phantom Thieves of Hearts.</p>
			<p>With Ann Takamaki joining them, the trio successfully changes Kamoshida’s heart, forcing him to confess his crimes of abuse and harassment at Shujin Academy. This marks the beginning of their journey as the Phantom Thieves—changing the hearts of corrupt individuals and bringing justice where the law fails.</p>

		<hr>
		<span style="text-align: left;">
			<p>As the Phantom Thieves’ reputation grows, they recruit new members, each with their own personal struggles: Yusuke Kitagawa, an artist manipulated by his corrupt mentor; Makoto Niijima, a model student oppressed by authority; Futaba Sakura, a reclusive hacker dealing with trauma; and Haru Okumura, a corporate heiress whose father exploits his workers. They continue reforming corrupt individuals, targeting figures like mafia leader Kaneshiro, corrupt TV producer Okumura, and others.</p>
			<p>However, their actions attract the attention of the public and the authorities, particularly Goro Akechi, a charismatic detective. Akechi initially joins them, but later reveals himself as a double agent working for Masayoshi Shido, a ruthless politician who orchestrated the protagonist’s false conviction. Akechi attempts to eliminate the Phantom Thieves but is ultimately betrayed by Shido and seemingly perishes.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, it is revealed that the Phantom Thieves’ activities were being manipulated by a higher power: Yaldabaoth, a god-like entity controlling society from the shadows. Yaldabaoth, disguised as the Velvet Room’s Igor, has been using the protagonist and Akechi in a cosmic game to determine the fate of humanity. With the public turning against the Phantom Thieves, they are forced to fight against Yaldabaoth in a climactic battle, ultimately defeating him and freeing society from his control.</p>

After an emotional fight, they manage to change his heart, restoring the real world.</p>
			<p>With their journey complete, the protagonist’s probation ends, and he prepares to leave Tokyo. However, if certain choices are made, Akechi’s fate remains ambiguous. The game ends with the protagonist and his friends moving forward, forever changed by their experiences.</p>
