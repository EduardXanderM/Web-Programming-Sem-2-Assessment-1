		<hr>
		<span style="text-align: left;">
			<p>The protagonist, a high school student, is falsely accused of assault while trying to help a woman and is sentenced to probation. Sent to Tokyo, he moves in with Sojiro Sakura, a coffee shop owner, and enrolls at Shujin Academy. While trying to adjust to his new life, he befriends Ryuji Sakamoto, an outcast with a grudge against their abusive gym teacher, Suguru Kamoshida.</p>
			<p>One day, they accidentally stumble into a mysterious alternate dimension known as the Metaverse, where people’s distorted desires take the form of Palaces—manifestations of their corrupt minds. In Kamoshida’s Palace, they meet Morgana, a talking cat-like creature who teaches them about Persona powers. The protagonist unlocks his Persona, Arsène, becoming the leader of a group that would later be known as the Phantom Thieves of Hearts.</p>
			<p>With Ann Takamaki joining them, the trio successfully changes Kamoshida’s heart, forcing him to confess his crimes of abuse and harassment at Shujin Academy. This marks the beginning of their journey as the Phantom Thieves—changing the hearts of corrupt individuals and bringing justice where the law fails.</p>

		<hr>
		<span style="text-align: left;">
			<p>As the Phantom Thieves’ reputation grows, they recruit new members, each with their own personal struggles: Yusuke Kitagawa, an artist manipulated by his corrupt mentor; Makoto Niijima, a model student oppressed by authority; Futaba Sakura, a reclusive hacker dealing with trauma; and Haru Okumura, a corporate heiress whose father exploits his workers. They continue reforming corrupt individuals, targeting figures like mafia leader Kaneshiro, corrupt TV producer Okumura, and others.</p>
			<p>However, their actions attract the attention of the public and the authorities, particularly Goro Akechi, a charismatic detective. Akechi initially joins them, but later reveals himself as a double agent working for Masayoshi Shido, a ruthless politician who orchestrated the protagonist’s false conviction. Akechi attempts to eliminate the Phantom Thieves but is ultimately betrayed by Shido and seemingly perishes.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, it is revealed that the Phantom Thieves’ activities were being manipulated by a higher power: Yaldabaoth, a god-like entity controlling society from the shadows. Yaldabaoth, disguised as the Velvet Room’s Igor, has been using the protagonist and Akechi in a cosmic game to determine the fate of humanity. With the public turning against the Phantom Thieves, they are forced to fight against Yaldabaoth in a climactic battle, ultimately defeating him and freeing society from his control.</p>

		<hr>
		<span style="text-align: left;">
			<p>In Persona 5 Royal, a new semester is introduced, revealing that reality has been altered. Dr. Maruki, a cognitive scientist, has gained control over the Metaverse and created an ideal world where everyone’s suffering is erased. Ryuji regains his lost track career, Futaba’s mother is alive, and Akechi is mysteriously back. However, this reality is built on illusions, taking away free will.</p>
			<p>The protagonist must choose whether to accept this world or fight to restore reality. The Phantom Thieves reunite and battle Maruki, who, despite his good intentions, ultimately understands that true happiness cannot be forced upon people. After an emotional fight, they manage to change his heart, restoring the real world.</p>
			<p>With their journey complete, the protagonist’s probation ends, and he prepares to leave Tokyo. However, if certain choices are made, Akechi’s fate remains ambiguous. The game ends with the protagonist and his friends moving forward, forever changed by their experiences.</p>

			<p>"The original Persona 5 was already a joy to play; however, this version definitely steps up to the plate and knocks it out of the park. If Persona 5 was a perfectly executed and baked sponge cake, Persona 5 Royal is the same perfect sponge cake... but now filled with lashings of jam and cream. Everything that has been added has been amazingly well implemented. This is a wonderful title, regardless of whether or not it is compared to the original… which is still a delectable sponge cake! The story, characters, music, gameplay, and animation - everything comes together and creates an experience that is the personification of JRPG perfection. Incredibly unique and enjoyable!"</p>

			<p>"I had to combine the story and conclusion to help paint a better picture about how I feel about Persona 5 Royal. I see a lot of people who criticize the story of this game, saying it’s basic or not that great, but personally I just don’t see it. I loved every aspect of this story. Kamoshida in the beginning was a really hateable villain who introduced some of the darker themes of this game. This was the best introduction to a game ever. I really sympathized with the Phantom Thieves and wanted to see the mission through.</p>
			<p>One of the aspects of this game I also enjoyed was how real the villains felt. You could imagine a corrupt mob boss or politician in real life doing these horrible things, and question a reality where you have the power to change things. This really spoke to me and highlighted what I believe is to be the greatest theme of this game: going out into the world and making change. There are always going to be shitty people in the world, so how will you make a change without having real Phantom Thieves? I asked myself this question as I played this game, and to be honest, I still don’t even have an answer. As someone leaving for college in a week and in a very developmental part of my life, I feel like this game really spoke to me in a way that no other media in general ever has. For me, this story is easily a 10/10, and I’ve never felt more impacted from any other media in my life. I hope that all young people (specifically adolescents and teenagers) get a chance to really experience this amazing story and take out what I did. This was an amazing introduction to more traditional JRPGs after not playing many beforehand, and I’ve already began playing Dragon Quest XI because I feel like I just need more.</p>
			<p>Thank you Atlus and thank you Persona 5 Royal for this breathtaking experience."</p>

			<p>"As this point it’s probably safe to say that I very much liked the game.</p>
			<p>As for why I liked it, despite being generally averse to RPGs of this type? I think the life-sim aspect of the game was the key driver – to me choosing your daily activities and levelling up social stats felt more in line with my idea of role-playing, as opposed to other JRPGs where the role-playing basically boils down to whether you use swords or magic to hurt your enemies. The fact that every activity progresses time was key as well – I find in other RPGs with a lot of side quests and activities it can easy to lose momentum and get bogged down in extra content, but the calendar system in Persona 5 ensured I was always making progress through the story, no matter what I chose to do.</p>
			<p>The story and setting were also important factors in keeping me engaged to the end. I’ve already discussed the story, but the setting in particular was something that appealed to me. I find I bounce off a lot of RPGs with a “high fantasy” setting – in some made up land with made up nations and made up races of people and creatures, as it takes me too long to properly immerse myself in these new worlds. I’m generally more of a sci-fi fan, but the fact that Persona 5 starts out as you essentially as a normal kid in the real world, and you regularly see the impact of your actions on the general public was something I really enjoyed, and was closer in concept to the fantasy/supernatural fiction that I’ve enjoyed in the past, such as Harry Potter, The Magicians and Death Note.</p>
			<p>Finally, what really brings everything together is the presentation. The hyper-stylised world is awesome to walk around in, and the flashy menus and sleek animations makes every action feel impactful. The music is probably the highlight in this regard, with at least a dozen absolute bangers that I’ll surely still be listening to for years to come."</p>
			<p>And that’s it! What a game! I didn’t even touch on many aspects of the game – persona fusion, mementos, the romance options – but they were all great too and really came together to make this game a masterpiece."</p>

			<p>"To conclude, Persona 5 is without question one of the greatest JRPGs ever and one of the greatest video games I’ve ever played! It’s incredibly fun and engaging gameplay both in managing the daily life of a high school student, and in the dungeon crawling turn-based combat is some of the best out of any JRPG I’ve played. Its story and characters are super well written, with emotional highs and lows, and with one of the best twists I’ve ever experienced, and the presentation is some of the best I’ve seen in any game ever. My experience playing this game over the course of this month has honestly been the most rewarding, engaging, and memorable gaming experiences I’ve had since when I first played Elden Ring. I’m so glad I got to experience this game for the first time finally. Persona 5 is an absolute masterpiece even if it has some flaws, so with that my final rating for Persona 5 is: 10/10!"</p>
